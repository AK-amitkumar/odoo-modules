#Google Drive Attachement Module for Odoo

This module allows the attachement of Google Drive document to all records and
also to directly upload new document to a dedicated folder on gdrive.

This will considerably reduce the size required for your attachement.

#Configuration

The folder where the files will be uploaded must be set in the 
Configuation/Knowledge section. Just browse your GDrive to the directory and
the id is in the url "https://...../folders/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX just copy everything
after /folders/ to the "Google Drive Upload Directory" parameter.

#What's next

An interesting behaviour would be to also replace the storage of reports
(invoices) generated by the reporting module.
